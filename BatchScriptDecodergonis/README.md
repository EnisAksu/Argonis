# BatchScript Decoder GUI

This tool provides a graphical interface to **decode obfuscated Windows batch scripts**, often encountered in malware samples or red team exercises. It helps **security analysts, reverse engineers, and incident responders** quickly understand encoded payloads without manually parsing and decoding the batch logic.

## ðŸ›  What Does It Do?

Batch malware and scripts often use techniques like:

- Setting an **alphabet variable** (e.g., `set UB=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz...`)
- Iterating over **numeric positions** (e.g., `for %i in (12;3;0;5;...)`)
- Using these positions to extract characters from the alphabet to **reconstruct a hidden command or payload**

This Python script automates that decoding process.

### Example

A batch snippet like:
```batch
set UB=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789
for %i in (0;1;2;25) do @set cmd=!cmd!!UB:~%i,1!
```
...would build a string from characters in `UB` based on those index positions.

This decoder will:
- Extract the `UB` string
- Parse the numeric values
- Map each value to a character in `UB`
- Rebuild and display the decoded string

## ðŸ’¡ How It Helps Security Analysts

- **Faster Triage**: Instead of manually decoding obfuscated commands, analysts can paste the batch script into the GUI and see the decoded result instantly.
- **Education**: Useful for those learning malware analysis or batch scripting obfuscation techniques.
- **Accuracy**: Reduces human error in decoding index-based string reconstructions.

## ðŸ§  How the Logic Works

1. **Alphabet Extraction**:
   - Looks for a line like `set VAR=...` to extract the "alphabet" used for indexing.

2. **Position Parsing**:
   - Finds the list of numbers in a `for` loop like `for %i in (0;1;2...)`, separated by either `;` or `,`.

3. **Character Reconstruction**:
   - For each index, grabs the corresponding character from the alphabet string and builds the decoded command.

4. **Output**:
   - Displays the result in a user-friendly GUI built using `tkinter`.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` (auto-installs if missing)

## ðŸš€ How to Run

```bash
python BatchScriptDecodergonis.py
```

A GUI window will open:
- Paste the batch code in the top box
- Click **"Decode"**
- See the result in the bottom box

## ðŸ‘´ Is This Old School?

Yes, batch script obfuscation is considered a bit "old school" in the modern malware landscape. However, it's **still relevant** in:
- Legacy malware
- Simplistic or fast-built droppers
- Red team exercises
- Real-world attacks on misconfigured or older Windows systems

Understanding these techniques remains crucial for a well-rounded security toolkit.
