# CVE-2025-33028 - WinZip Mark-of-the-Web Bypass Vulnerability

## Vulnerability Overview
A **Mark-of-the-Web (MotW) Bypass Vulnerability** has been discovered in **WinZip** (up to version 76.9), which allows attackers to bypass the Mark-of-the-Web protection mechanism. This flaw allows extracted files from a malicious archive to lose the MotW tag, making the system treat them as local files and bypass any security warnings that would normally prevent execution of potentially harmful files.

## Vulnerability Description
WinZip does not propagate the Mark-of-the-Web protection to the extracted files when opening an archive that has been downloaded from the internet. As a result, files such as macro-enabled Office documents or executable scripts are treated as trusted files and can be executed without triggering security alerts.

## Exploitation Chain
1. The attacker crafts a malicious archive (e.g., `.zip` or `.7z`) containing a file (e.g., `.bat` or `.cmd`).
2. The archive is downloaded from the internet and tagged with the **Mark-of-the-Web (MotW)**.
3. The archive is opened with WinZip, and the contents are extracted.
4. The **MotW is stripped** from the extracted files, allowing them to be trusted and executed.
5. Malicious macros or scripts inside the extracted file can then be executed.

## CVSS Score
**CVSS v3.0 Score**: **7.8 - High**
- **Attack Vector**: Local
- **Complexity**: Low
- **Privileges Required**: None
- **User Interaction**: Required (the target must open the malicious archive)

## Affected Products
- **WinZip** versions **76.9** (Windows 64-bit)
- No fix available as of now.

## Impact
- **Code execution**: Malicious scripts or executables can be executed on the user's system.
- **Escalation of Privileges**: Attackers can gain control in the context of the current user.
- **Information Disclosure**: Sensitive information may be exposed.

## Exploitation Example
1. Download or create a macro-enabled `.bat` file.
2. Compress it into a `.zip` archive.
3. Extract the `.zip` archive using **WinZip**.
4. The extracted `.docm` file will **not** have the MotW, which means macros can execute without warning.
