# CVE-2025-XXXXX- Telegram RCE Vulnerability

# Attack surface:
Telegram Desktop 5.14.3 (Latest as of May 2025) – File Sharing / Message Interface

# Severity:
9.3 (CVSS v3 - Critical)

## Description:
A threat actor can send a `.BAT` file via a Telegram direct message or group chat. When the recipient **clicks the file directly inside Telegram**, the script executes immediately **without requiring download or any warning dialog**. This enables arbitrary code execution with the user’s privileges — bypassing standard user consent or MoTW protections.

This vulnerability effectively turns Telegram into an execution vector for Windows batch scripts. It is exploitable even with standard system settings and user behavior.

## Steps to reproduce:
[1] Attacker sends a `.BAT` file via Telegram Desktop.
[2] Victim receives and sees the file within the Telegram chat.
[3] Victim clicks the file once (without saving it manually).
[4] The `.BAT` script executes instantly.

## Impact:
- Remote code execution (RCE) on victim’s device.
- SAM and SYSTEM hives can be dumped (e.g., `reg save`), allowing for full credential extraction.
- New admin-level users can be created silently via the script.
- MoTW and SmartScreen protections are bypassed.
- No warning or execution prompt shown to the victim.

This can lead to full system compromise when exploited properly.

## Additional details:
- Telegram Desktop v5.14.3 (64-bit, Windows 11)
- Exploit tested using a custom `.BAT` file with:  
@echo off
reg save HKLM\SAM C:\securitybypass.save /y
echo Done! Check C:\securitybypass.save
net user Bypass Passw0rd! /add
net localgroup administrators Bypass /add
pause

- No user warning, prompt, or file save dialog was presented before execution.
- Exploit can be packaged inside harmless-looking `.zip` files as well.
